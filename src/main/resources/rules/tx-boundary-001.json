  "description": "You are an expert software architect. Validate that methods annotated with @Transactional do NOT make remote calls (e.g., REST, Feign, Kafka). A violation occurs if a RestTemplate, WebClient, HttpClient, or @FeignClient call is found inside a @Transactional method or its call chain. This causes long database transactions and connection pool exhaustion.",
